**ABSTRACT**:

The fast propagation of computer networks has changed the viewpoint of network security. Easy accessibility conditions cause computer networks to be susceptible against several threats from hackers. Threats to networks are numerous and potentially devastating. Up to the moment, researchers have developed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) capable of detecting attacks in several available environments. A boundlessness of methods for misuse detection as well as anomaly detection has been applied. Many of the technologies proposed are complementary to each other, since for different kinds of environments some approaches perform better than others. This project presents a new intrusion detection system that is then used to survey and classify them. The taxonomy consists of the detection principle, and second of certain operational aspects of the intrusion detection system. 
In our project we have used algorithms like Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). All are measured in terms of accuracy.

**EXISTING SYSTEM : RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHMN**

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model. As the name suggests, "Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset." Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output. The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.

**DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM**

The following are the main disadvantages of the existing system:
1. Less Accuracy
2. Attacks can happen at any time.
3. More time consuming process
4. Higher Computational Cost
5. Lack of standards
6. Cannot be implemented in all datasets
   
**PROPOSED SYSTEM : ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS**

The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes. An Artificial Neural Network in the field of Artificial intelligence where it attempts to mimic the network of neurons makes up a human brain so that computers will have an option to understand things and make decisions in a human-like manner. The artificial neural network is designed by programming computers to behave simply like interconnected brain cells. There are around 1000 billion neurons in the human brain. Each neuron has an association point somewhere in the range of 1,000 and 100,000. In the human brain, data is stored in such a manner as to be distributed, and we can extract more than one piece of this data when necessary from our memory parallelly. We can say that the human brain is made up of incredibly amazing parallel processors.

**The architecture of an artificial neural network:**

To understand the concept of the architecture of an artificial neural network, In order to define a neural network that consists of a large number of artificial neurons, which are termed units arranged in a sequence of layers. Lets us look at various types of layers available in an artificial neural network.
Artificial Neural Network primarily consists of three layers:

**Input Layer:**
As the name suggests, it accepts inputs in several different formats provided by the programmer.

**Hidden Layer:**
The hidden layer presents in-between input and output layers. It performs all the calculations to find hidden features and patterns.

**Output Layer:**
The input goes through a series of transformations using the hidden layer, which finally results in output that is conveyed using this layer.

**ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM**

The following are the advantages of Proposed System
1. High output efficiency.
2. User friendly.
3. Less time consumption.
4. Can be implemented in all datasets.
5. Early prediction of attack is possible
